title: "Bash Arg Parsing"

As much as I prefer nearly any other language to Bash (or other Shell scripting)
time and again I find myself scripting in Bash.

* Working with existing Bash scripts in a code-base.
* 'Quick' command line utilities.

A recent challenge I ran into was how to handle Bash arg parsing well.

Resources
==============

* [Shelldorado - Arg parsing](http://www.shelldorado.com/goodcoding/cmdargs.html)
* [Drew Stokes - Bash Argument Parsing](https://medium.com/@Drew_Stokes/bash-argument-parsing-54f3b81a6a8f)
* [Stackoverflow - How to parse command line arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192249/how-do-i-parse-command-line-arguments-in-bash)

Qualities of Interest
======================

1. *Brittleness* : Likelihood of errors during development / usage.
2. *User Readability* : Ability for user to infer meaning of arguments.
3. *Ease of Development* : Ease of adding arg parsing to script.
4. *Maintainability* : Ability of the modify/extend arguments easily and correctly.
5. *Optionality* : Ability to handle optional arguments.

Variants
==============

Positional
--------------

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "arg1 : $1"
echo "arg2 : $2"
```

Scores
-----

* **Brittleness** : **1 - HIGH**
  * if we have a sequence of 6 arguments ```my_script 1 2 5 3 4 6``` not obvious when arguments are not placed correctly.
* **User Readability** : **1 - NONE**
  * ```my_script file1 file2``` doesn't give any hints as to what is happening. Even if we know there is a source and target file - which is which?
* **Ease of Development** : **5 - EASY**
  * Very easy for simple use cases with 1-3 required arguments.
* **Maintainability** : **1 - HARD**
  * Modifying existing script involves tracking down opaque `$2` and perhaps shifting all arguments forward `$2 -> $3`.
* **Optional Arguments** : **1 - Difficult**
  * Can allow trailing arguments to be optional, but requires a strict ordering of which arguments
  you expect the user to use.

When to use : One off you will throw away quickly.

getopts
---------------

* [wikipedia - getopts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getopts)
* [bash hackers](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/howto/getopts_tutorial)
* [gnu - getopts](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html)
* [manpage](https://ss64.com/bash/getopts.html)
* [Examples - Kevin Sookocheff](https://sookocheff.com/post/bash/parsing-bash-script-arguments-with-shopts/)
* [Examples - atomic object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/03/30/parsing-arguments-in-bash-with-getopts/)

Getopts was first introduced in 1986 in the Bourne shell [Bourne Shell Family](http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/bourne/)

Basic example

```
optarg_example.sh
```

```bash
vflag=off
while getopts f:v opt
do
    case "$opt" in
      v)  vflag=on;;
      f)  filename="$OPTARG";;
      \?)       # unknown flag
          echo >&2 \
      "usage: $0 [-v] [-f filename] [file ...]"
      exit 1;;
    esac
done
shift 'expr $OPTIND - 1'
```

The syntax ```getopts a:bc opt``` indicates that getopts can expect

* Options ```-a``` followed by arguments that will get stored in ```OPTARG```
* Options ```-b, -c``` without arguments
* None of the options are required.
* Getopt will throw an error if ```-a``` not followed by an argument : ```option requires an argument```
* When an option ```-a```, etc is found the character ```a``` is stored in ```opt```.

What is happening? Getopts steps through the command line values looking for the flags definedsets and manipulates the following variables.

* OPTIND - current index initialized to 1 and needs to be reset to 1 if you want to re-use getopts.
* OPTARG - stores the argument corresponding to current option.

* It will stop parsing on the first non-option / non-argument value (a string that doesn't begin with a hyphen that isn't the argument for any option in front of it).
* It will also stop parsing when it sees ```--``` (double-hyphen)

Scores
---

* **Brittleness** : **3 - Medium**
  * Not dependent on order of parameters.
  * Serious issue for me. In the prior example ```bash optarg_example.sh -f -v``` **does not throw an error**. Instead ```-v``` is treated as the argument for ```-f```. This behavior is well known, but is still worisome.
* **User Readability** : **2 - Low**
  * ```md_convert -i file.md -o bears```. We have more hints - in this case maybe
an input and an output?
  * Doesn't support more readable options ```--input```.
* **Ease of Development** : **2 - Low**
  * Requires knowing special syntax.
* **Maintainability** : **3 - Ok**
  * A little easier to maintain than write from scratch.
* **Optional Arguments** : **3 - Ok**
  * All arguments are optional.

* *Bonus* : Option stacking familiar from ```tar -xvf, ls -lm```.

getopt
---------------

A descendent of ```getopts```

[Bahnanm - getopt](http://www.bahmanm.com/blogs/command-line-options-how-to-parse-in-bash-using-getopt)
[man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html)


Why didn't we use getopt in the first place? There is one drawback with the use of getopt: it removes whitespace within arguments. The command line

    one "two three" four
(three command line arguments) is rewritten as
    one two three four
(four arguments). Don't use the getopt command if the arguments may contain whitespace characters.

    case "$1" in
        -v)  vflag=on;;
        -*)
            echo >&2 "usage: $0 [-v] [file ...]"
            exit 1;;
        *)  break;; # terminate while loop
    esac
    shift
done
```

    case "$1" in
        -v)  vflag=on;;
    -f)  filename="$2"; shift;;
    --) shift; break;;
    -*)
        echo >&2 \
        "usage: $0 [-v] [-f file] [file ...]"
        exit 1;;
    *)  break;; # terminate while loop
    esac
    shift
done
# all command line switches are processed,
# "$@" contains all file names
```
