"One of the principle objects of theoretical research in any department of knowledge is to find the point of view from which the subject appears in its greatest simplicity." - Josiah Willard Gibbs

This is the core thread of my research / professional career across Theoretical Physics (Quantum Gravity & General Relativity), applied math, machine learning, and software engineering.
