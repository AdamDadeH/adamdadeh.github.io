Frequentist Confidence Interval
-------------------------------

Family of probability measures $p_{\theta}$ on $X$, $\theta \in \Theta$

Given $\theta$ we can construct $A_{\alpha}(\rho_\theta, \mu)$

Given measurement $x$ we can construct

$C(x, \alpha, \mu, \rho) = \{ \theta | x \in A_{\alpha}(\rho_\theta, \mu) \}$

Under coordinate change $f : X \to Y$ this transforms as

$f \star C(x, \alpha, \mu, \rho) =
\{ \theta | f(x) \in A_{\alpha}(f^*\rho_\theta, \mu) \}
= \{ \theta | x \in f^{-1}(A_{\alpha}(f^*\rho_\theta, \mu)) \}
= \{ \theta | x \in A_{\alpha}(\rho_\theta, f^{-1} \mu) \}$


Relate to minimizing loss of mis-estimation.

Properties of Coverage Sets
----------

<look up proper name for>

Given probability space $(X, \rho)$
Given a coverage set $A_{\alpha}$ defined given level $\alpha$ and a measure $\mu$ on $X$.

How does this transform under a function $X$ to $Y$.
We push forward measure $\rho$ to $f^*(\rho)$ on

Failure of Precise Interpretation
-------

Suppose we have samples from a normal distribution $N(0, \sigma)$ with unknown $\sigma$.

$x_t$

Sample is a point in $\mathbb{R}^T$ - no - is really N! points of permutations of the observations.
With density $exp^{-\sum_t x_t^2/2 \sigma^2}$

Given the flat reference measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$ we are asking for the $\sigma$ such that the measure of points within
