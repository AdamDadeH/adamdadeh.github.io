Invariant features of idealized images.

An idealized grayscale image is a map

$f : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow [0, 1]$

* Assuming infinite resolution - no pixels.
* Assuming no boundary.
* Assuming continuous color levels.

For these idealized images we expect invariance of classification  / object detection under arbitrary translations and rotations

Linear Feature :

$\int dxdy f(x,y)$

Is translation and rotation invariant.

Quadratic Features:

$\int dx_1 dy_1 dx_2 dy_2 a(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) f(x_1, y_1) f(x_2, y_2)$

Translation invariance implies

$a(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2) = a(x_1 + d, x_2 + d, y_1 + d', y_2 + d')$ for all $d,d'$

So we can restrict to defining $a(x, 0, y, 0)$.

Using rotation invariance.
