draft: true
---

String diagrams in symmetric monoidal categories are the natural generalization of Einstein index notation beyond linear maps. A box is a morphism, a wire is a typed channel, and composition is connection. The semantics are exactly those of Einstein notation: binding is by name, reordering is free, and the type of each wire is explicit.

The problem: string diagrams are diagrammatic. Spatial layout is not parseable, not typecheckable, and not composable by a program.

The question: **what is the textual / algebraic syntax that captures the same semantics?**

## What We Want

A notation with:

- **Named binding** — wires identified by label, not position. $A_i^{\;j} u^i$ and $u^i A_i^{\;j}$ are the same expression.
- **Typed wires** — each wire carries a type; connection requires type agreement.
- **Arbitrary morphisms** — not restricted to linear maps.
- **Compositional** — terms compose the way diagrams compose: sequentially ($\circ$) and in parallel ($\otimes$).
- **Machine parseable** — a program can typecheck and evaluate a term.

## What Exists

**Einstein / index notation** — the linear case. Summation convention handles contraction; index height handles covariant/contravariant distinction. Textual, parseable, and powerful within its domain. Does not extend to nonlinear morphisms.

**`einsum` / `einops`** — textual notation for tensor contraction in array programming. `"ij,jk->ik"` for matrix multiplication. Extends Einstein notation with explicit output specification. Still restricted to multilinear operations.

**Free symmetric monoidal category term syntax** — formally, string diagrams correspond to terms in an algebraic language with generators, $\otimes$, $\circ$, symmetry maps, and named wire variables. Joyal and Street's correspondence makes this precise. Not yet a practical notation.

**Catlab.jl** — Julia library for applied category theory. Wiring diagrams as first-class data structures: programmatically composable, visualizable, and executable. The closest existing tool to what we want. [Catlab.jl](https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/)

**The $\pi$-calculus** — process calculus with named, typed channels and explicit binding. Textual, compositional, machine parseable. The semantics of channel communication are those of wire connection in a string diagram. Typed variants ($\pi$-types, session types) bring this closer to the categorical setting.

## Key Questions

- Is there a canonical textual syntax for free SMCs that is both human-readable and machine-parseable?
- How does index height (covariant/contravariant) generalize beyond the linear case — is there an analog for general morphisms?
- Can `einsum`-style notation be extended to nonlinear operations? What breaks?
- What is the relationship between session types and typed string diagram wires?
- Catlab as a practical tool: how far does it get toward this as a working notation?
